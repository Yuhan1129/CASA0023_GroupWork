As a result a disturbing feature of this trend is proliferation of informal housing development in cities of developing countries. A great deal of importance in recent years has been put forwarded to the informal housing sector. The common characteristics of informal housing are insecurity of tenure, low standard of infrastructure and services. By the end of 1980s, international donor agencies like World Bank, UN agencies had given increasing significance to informal housing policies and infrastructure provision in cities in developing countries.},

  abstract = {This study examined socio-demographic factors that account for the construction of authorized houses in peri-urban areas of Ghana. Using Bamahu, a rapidly growing suburb of Wa in Ghana as a case study, the paper contributes to the position that a holistic understanding of the demand side factors accounting for the growth of illegal housing in today’s emerging cities is a prerequisite to achieving sustainable urban development. A cross-sectional survey design was adopted for the study whilst a multistage sampling process was used to identify respondents. Questionnaires were administered to 270 homeowners. Descriptive statistics and the Chi square test of independence were used to analyze the data. With the exception of site plans, majority (53.0\%, 53.3\%, 52.2\% and 50.4\%) of homeowners did not obtain indentures, building plans, building permits and land title certificates respectively before building. The tendency to construct an unauthorized building was greatly influenced by the mode of land acquisition and the highest level of education attained by the homeowner, whilst gender of the homeowner had no significant (p\,{$>$}\,0.05) influence on the acquisition of such documentations. A mix of relationships was however identified between occupation, house type and the acquisition of land and building documentations. Policy reforms and intensifying sensitization exercises for prospective homebuilders and customary landholders on procedures and processes in land acquisition and its subsequent development is recommended.},

  abstract = {Illegal buildings (IBs) are a dramatic problem in developing countries due to the population explosion, but, at the same time, they represent an unsolved issue in several states usually called advanced (as, for instance, Italy). To protect the environment, and hence, people, land authorities must respond to the challenge of IBs by demolishing them. However, in countries where the phenomenon is extended, it is indispensable to provide those figures with an IT tool that returns to them an order of demolition. Through remote sensing methods, suspicious buildings can be identified with a good approximation, but they are all ex aequo. The research summarized in this paper formalizes a two-steps method to deal with a specific category of IBs, namely, those that are close to rivers. These buildings are of special interest to land authorities because people living or simply working inside them are exposed to the flood hazard that each year claims many victims all over the world. The first step of the method computes the census of the IBs located close to rivers, while the second step computes the ranking of these buildings. The ranking may be used as the IBs demolition order. In the paper, it is also proposed the structure of a Spatial DataBase (briefly, SDB) that is suitable to store the input data necessary to solve the problem, as well as the final ranking. Spatial SQL queries against the SDB implement the proposed two-steps method. A real case study was carried out to make a preliminary validation of the method.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, forest fires exert effects on natural ecosystems, contributing to economic/human losses, health effects, and climate change. Spectral indices are an essential tool for monitoring and analyzing forest fires. These indices make it possible to evaluate the affected areas and help mitigate possible future events and reduce damage. The case study addressed in this work corresponds to the Cerro of the Guadual community of La Carolina parish (Ibarra, Ecuador). This work aims to evaluate the degree of severity and the recovery of post-fire vegetation, employing the multitemporal analysis of spectral indices and correlating these with the climatological aspects of the region. The methodological process was based on (i) background information collection, (ii) remote sensing data, (iii) spectral index analysis, (iv) multivariate analysis, and (v) a forest fire action plan proposal. Landsat-8 OLI satellite images were used for multitemporal analysis (2014–2020). Using the dNDVI index, the fire’s severity was classified as unburned and very low severity in regard to the areas that did not regenerate post-fire, which represented 10,484.64 ha. In contrast, the areas classified as high and very high severity represented 5859.06 ha and 2966.98 ha, respectively. In addition, the dNBR was used to map the burned areas. The high enhanced regrowth zones represented an area of 8017.67 ha, whereas the moderate/high-severity to high-severity zones represented 3083.72 ha and 1233.49 ha, respectively. The areas with a high severity level corresponded to native forests, which are challenging to recover after fires. These fire severity models were validated with 31 in situ data from fire-starting points and they presented an accuracy of 99.1\% in the high severity category. In addition, through the application of principal component analysis (PCA) with data from four meteorological stations in the region, a bimodal behavior was identified corresponding to the climatology of the area (dry season and rainy season), which is related to the presence of fires (in the dry season). It is essential to note that after the 2014 fire, locally, rainfall decreased and temperatures increased. Finally, the proposed action plan for forest fires made it possible to define a safe and effective evacuation route to reduce the number of victims during future events.},

Grounded architectural practice (GAP) is developed as a conceptual framework to explore an emergent form of contextually appropriate architectural practice in the context of a resident-driven in situ informal settlement upgrading project. The exploration takes the form of a descriptive narrative. Each challenge that arose during the descriptive narrative was mapped according to Engeström’s activity system model, an analytical tool emanating from cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). By participating in live projects in informal settlements and analysing these projects by means of CHAT, the authors explored the highly improvising and generative everyday practices of the urban majority. Architectural practice in such a context requires a multi-disciplinary approach which extends beyond conventional professional boundaries, and attention must be paid to building the capacity of all participants to function in such uncharted territory.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the challenging issue of illegal building in Italy with a view to clearing up the picture on this subject matter. This phenomenon is scarcely treated from an analytical/scientific point of view, especially in international literature. However, it is very present in the social and journalistic debate. Our research highlights the objective lack of data needed to gauge this offence, which is less endemic than is believed. Furthermore, it proves that existing data are insufficient to produce results, which often range between reality and prejudice, depicting some areas of the country in an extremely negative way. The first part of this paper describes the extreme complexity in acquiring “real” data and the total nation-wide lack of technical-administrative structures and methods capable of producing acceptably reliable information. In the second part, an emblematic case study is presented and its history traced back. We show that the multiform phenomena associated with illegal building create an enormous and rhetorical stratification of actions that ultimately do not lead to any appreciable result. This underscores the powerlessness of the administrative, regulatory and technical apparatus towards this particular infringement of territorial law.},

As a developing country, since 1950, Turkey has been trying to deal with illegal settlement and construction issues and by the year 2000, it took yet another turn with the concept of “urban regeneration” in the urban areas. Based on this concept, this article has introduced general characteristics of slum regeneration and implementation stages of a regeneration project have been compiled with current data. One of the different implementations has been selected between many other projects and analyzed from a legal and technical perspective. How the region that was in the world megaslum list in 2005 had been transformed into the habitable places was explained. Thanks to this implementation project that contains a special regeneration law for the first time in Turkey, a new lifestyle has been provided for the gecekondu owners, landownerhip problems have been resolved, and squatter settlements have been legalized. The project shows that if they are well planned and developed, including through integrated planning and management approaches, cities can promote economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable societies.},

  abstract = {Illegal building construction can be a problematic issue on densely populated metropolitan cities, especially because it leads to crooked civilization and unbalanced urban structure. The development plans define a maximum boundary for building coverage and floor ratios, but practically it is challenging to apply the plans to the real life in partly unplanned cities that are going under urban transformation, such as Istanbul. Rapidly changing settlements make it crucial to track property statuses carefully since there can be juristic consequences. In this study, we use airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) point cloud data, stereo KOMPSAT-3 images and development plans of Guzeltepe district, locating in Uskudar/Istanbul of Turkey to detect the structures built against the development plans. The plans were converted into aGeographical Information System ( GIS) environment for the ease of analysis. Digital elevation models and digital surface models (DSMs) were created with both LIDAR and stereo KOMPSAT-3 data to obtain normalized DSMs for extracting the heights of the buildings. These heights extracted from our models were then compared with the planned boundaries. Also, the two different dataset’s accuracies were analyzed. Our research may have direct implications on automatically building 3D plans and eventually instrumental for identification of illegal buildings.},

  abstract = {Landsat occupies a unique position in the constellation of civilian earth observation satellites, with a long and rich scientific and applications heritage. With nearly 40 years of continuous observation – since launch of the first satellite in 1972 – the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century.},

  abstract = {This study returns to the topic of unauthorised development in the south of Italy. It starts by assessing the main positions that have informed the debate since the 1960s and evaluates the consequences of the condono edilizio (building amnesty) policy, in the light of the impact that illegal construction has had on the landscape, both urban, rural and coastal. A close observation of three case studies, unplanned settlements in Lazio, Campania and Sicily, suggests that the original energies and expectations behind their development have long since lost their momentum. Rather, the emergence of new evolutionary trends—hitherto underrepresented within the political debate—demand a different interpretative framework. Three design scenarios are outlined, based on recycling existing social and physical material: they translate into a future-oriented discourse those symptoms of change that are already appearing in an embryonic form throughout Italy’s Mezzogiorno.},

abstract = {The information on building features especially in the urban area is very important to support urban management and development. Nevertheless, the automated and transferable detection of building features is still challenging because of variations of the spatial and spectral characteristics to support urban building classification using remote sensing techniques. Most previous studies utilized high-resolution images to discriminate buildings from other land use in the urban area and indeed it involves a high cost to achieve that purpose. Consequently, this study utilized a medium resolution remote sensing image, Sentinel-2B with a 10-meter spatial resolution to classified the building in Selangor, Malaysia. In order to obtain a good classification accuracy, the suitable segmentation parameters (scale, shape and compactness) and features selection for building detection have been determined. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers have been applied to categorized five different classes which are water, forest, green area, building, and road. The result from these two classifiers was then have been compared and it is obviously showing that the SVM classifier is able to produce 20% better accuracy compared to the DT classifier, with 93% and kappa is 0.92. Thus, by enhancing the classification techniques in OBIA, building extraction accuracy using ML algorithms for medium resolution images can be improved and the expenses can be reduced as well.}

ABSTRACT = {Based on a newly adopted “Rulebook on the records of identified changes on buildings in Serbia” (2020) that regulates the content, establishment, maintenance and use of records on identified changes on buildings, it is expected that the geodetic-cadastral information system will be extended with these records. The records contain data on determined changes of buildings in relation to the reference epoch of aerial or satellite imagery, namely data on buildings: (1) that are not registered in the real estate cadastre; (2) which are registered in the real estate cadastre, and have been changed in terms of the dimensions in relation to the data registered in the real estate cadastre; (3) which are registered in the real estate cadastre, but are removed on the ground. For this purpose, the LADM-based cadastral data model for Serbia is extended to include records on identified changes on buildings. In the year 2020, Republic Geodetic Authority commenced a new satellite acquisition for the purpose of restoration of official buildings registry, as part of a World Bank project for improving land administration in Serbia. Using this satellite imagery and existing cadastral data, we propose a method based on comparison of object-based and pixel-based image analysis approaches to automatically detect newly built, changed or demolished buildings and import these data into extended cadastral records. Our results, using only VHR images containing only RGB and NIR bands, showed object identification accuracy ranging from 84% to 88%, with kappa statistic from 89% to 96%. The accuracy of obtained results is satisfactory for the purpose of developing a register of changes on buildings to keep cadastral records up to date and to support activities related to legalization of illegal buildings, etc.},
